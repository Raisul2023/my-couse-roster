# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

*State management of my project:

=>First of all i created a useState in Home.jsx file in order to store the fake json data.Then I created another useState to store the selected course data in order to show it in the cart.Then I created 3 more useState with initial value to store the remaining credit hour, total credit hour and total price.
